This is an API for Welcome to Night Vale I am developing using the podcast's RSS feed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project's base directory and run `bin/rails server` to start the server.

## Usage

This API is currently not usable.

Example episode JSON objects are structured like this:

    {

      duration: "21:02",
      number: "1",
      summary: "Pilot Episode. A new dog park opens in Night Vale. Carlos, a scientist, visits and discovers some interesting things. Seismic things. Plus, a helpful guide to surveillance helicopter-spotting.",
      title: "Pilot"
    }
